# About-Me

Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a versatile professional with a unique blend of technical expertise and business acumen. I have hands-on experience in SAP ERP (MM,PP) custom application development, project management, and business systems analysis. Iâ€™ve made significant contributions to the healthcare sector through 30+ projects, including the COVID-19 vaccine development across 3 global plant locations. My peers recognize me for my excellent analytical skills, approachable nature and my commitment to deliver high quality work.

Iâ€™m currently pursuing a master's degree in Information Systems and a certification in Business Analytics, set to graduate in May 2024. These programs have provided me with advanced skills in Data Visualization (Tableau Certified, Power BI), Data Mining (Python, SQL), Business Intelligence (KPIs, ETL/ELT) and Project Management (Agile, Waterfall, SDLC, PMLC).
