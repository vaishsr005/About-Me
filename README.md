# About-Me

Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ I am an inquisitive problem-solver with 3+ years of industry experience in Data Analytics and Business Intelligence. I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Information Systems along with a certification in Business Analytics. I bring a robust skill set and a proven track record in data analytics across various business modules, particularly specializing in manufacturing, supply chain, sales and marketing analytics. My expertise extends to data visualization tools such as Tableau and Power BI, where I create intuitive dashboards and reports to represent complex business data. I am not only adept at statistical analysis, including regressions and A/B tests, but also have experience in applying these methods to address manufacturing, sales and supply chain analytics challenges.

With a history of independently managing projects, I have successfully engaged with cross-functional teams, developing strong relationships with partners at all levels of an organization. My ability to communicate effectively, handle confidential data, and adapt to dynamic business needs positions me as an ideal professional. I possess a helpful blend of skills, including familiarity with Python and a solid understanding of statistical methods. Moreover, my experience with international and multinational data sources and Tableau certification adds significant value. As an individual with a self-starter mentality and a curiosity to learn, I am ready to contribute to elevating Operations and Technology teams, ensuring insightful data exploration and valuable contributions to dashboarding and reporting needs within the company.
